# lxc-toys

I'm using Linux Containers more these days, so I'm going to put lxc-adjacent utilities I write in this repo.

Feedback welcome :)

# brief description of each tool

| name               | description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `lxc-ip-addresses` | lists running containers with their IP addresses. no arguments for all containers, or name any number of containers you're interested in |
